            <h1>About <span id="me">Me</span></h1>
            <p>Hi! I’m Sanvi, and I’m a senior at Westborough High School. I’ve lived in Westborough for the past 10
                years now, but before that, I was basking in the California sun. The move to Massachusetts in the middle
                of winter wasn’t exactly pleasant, but experiencing my first snow day—getting to make a snow angel, have
                a snowball fight, and build a snowman (things I’d only ever seen on TV before)—won me over. I’ve made so
                many memories here and am excited to gain new experiences and create even more!</p>
            <p>Although I love computer science, I also enjoy art, reading, and having movie nights with my friends. My
                favorite book is currently <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> by Jane Austen. I read it for the first time in my
                English class junior year, and I absolutely fell in love with its witty, sarcastic humor and the
                character of Elizabeth Bennet. My favorite movie is <em>Into the Spiderverse</em>; I loved the story and found it
                visually stunning. I'm looking forward to the release of <em>Beyond the Spiderverse!</em></p>
            <p>Please look around my website to learn more about my different activities and projects! All the code for
                this website can be found on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sanvi-g07/portfolio-website">my
                    GitHub</a>.</p>
