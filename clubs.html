                    <p>Throughout my life, I’ve noticed that there is a lack of women in the computer science field. In
                        my coding classes before high school, I was used to being either the only girl, or one of a few
                        in a majority male class. I was disappointed that this didn’t change much in high school. During
                        my Intro to Python class, I was saddened to see that I was only one out of three girls in the
                        whole class, and the only freshman girl. Knowing that this lack of representation intimidates
                        other girls from giving the field a try, I decided to create this club to provide a safe space
                        where others can learn to code without fear of being judged.</p>

                        As Treasurer, I put together a few bake sales throughout the year to raise money for Abby’s
                        House, a women’s shelter in Worcester. It was overall successful, since we raised over $200 to
                        donate! We also put up statistics regarding the disparity between genders on our bulletin board
                        to make people more aware of the issue.</p>

                    <p id="nhsDescription">I was inducted into NHS my sophomore year. Through NHS, I’ve volunteered at a
                        multitude of events
                        in our town, like placing flags in the rotary downtown for Independence Day, raking leaves for
                        the elderly, and cleaning up trash at the sides of the road. My junior year, I was elected
                        secretary. As secretary, I keep track of the attendance of our 213 members, help people when
                        they have issues with their hours, post about the new volunteer opportunities in our Google
                        Classroom, and send out reminders to make sure nobody falls behind. I have also taken the
                        initiative to change some practices to make it easier for the board and our members: namely,
                        creating a calendar, reorganizing the Google Classroom, and changing the ID and attendance
                        system. I created a calendar that all of our NHS members can access with all our events,
                        meetings, and any other important dates/deadlines. It’s color-coded so people can easily find
                        what they are looking for, and overall helps keep people on track with their hours. I also
                        reorganized the Google Classroom by utilizing the ‘topics’ tool from Google Classroom, since the
                        stream can get cluttered very easily and people will miss out on seeing some events. With the
                        ‘topics’ feature and posting new events as assignments, people can easily see what events there
                        are and which ones they went to. Finally, I used my computer science skills to automate sending
                        out all 213 members their ID, as the previous secretary sent them out one by one. I also wrote a
                        program to figure out which members were absent at meetings, since the previous secretary
                        went through each attendance form response individually to figure out who wasn’t there. I will
                        teach the future NHS secretary how to use these programs, and hopefully from now on, the NHS
                        board will have a much easier time of completing these tasks.</p>

                    <p>I’ve been a member of Student Council since my freshman year. Not only have I helped out with
                        several events, such as Homecoming, Summer Music Festival, and Mental Health Week, but I’ve also
                        led a number of events. My freshman year, I organized a Community Appreciations event, where we
                        made a bunch of positive messages to put up downtown. I led Winter Ball my sophomore year, and
                        had the large job of managing all the tasks that we needed to complete, like advertising, ticket
                        selling, decoration prep, along with directing people with set up and clean up on the day of the
                        dance itself. My junior year, I held two Babysitting Nights. Parents could drop off their kid on
                        Friday night for 3 hours to play games, watch a movie, and have fun while they could go get
                        other things done. This event was slightly more stressful, as I had the added pressure of taking
                        care of people’s children and making sure everyone was accounted for. Although both of these
                        events were a lot of work, my organizational skills and management abilities allowed us to get
                        through all these events smoothly. All of my events combined have raised over $1700 for Student
                        Council, that is used to put on even better events for our school and town.</p>

                    <p>I’ve been selected to be a New Student Ambassador since my sophomore year. As a New Student
                        Ambassador, I help out with a lot of the events our school holds for new
                        students. In the summer, I lead tours around the school for Freshmen Orientation, teaching
                        freshmen how to navigate the building, where important areas are located, and what they can
                        expect when they first come to high school. There is also another event called New Student
                        Night, where we do similar tours, but for new students who aren’t freshmen or freshmen who
                        couldn’t make Freshmen Orientation. During the school year, I help direct parents during Open
                        House as they try to find their children’s classrooms. In the remainer of the school year, I've helped give tours to any new students who arrive, and I also helped the
                        guidance counselors give a presentation to freshmen about how they can expect high school to go
                        and how to begin planning for after high school, giving insights about my
                        high school experience. I like being a friendly face that these new students can look to for
                        help during this stressful period.

                    <p>Since freshman year, I’ve been a member of WAVE, a volunteer group for the Westborough Public
                        Library. Through WAVE, I’ve helped run a variety of events, such as the Around the World
                        Carnival or Family Field Day. I also help out a lot with Circulation, so I find the books that
                        people put holds on and bring them to the front desk to be checked in. Another event I help with
                        a lot is Homework Help, where we help kids grades K-8 with any questions on their homework they
                        might have. It’s very rewarding to help out with these events and get the chance to give back to
                        my town.
