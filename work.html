                <p>At Code Ninjas, I worked as a Code Ninjas “Sensei”. My job was to work through the curriculum, grade
                    projects, provide feedback, and help kids when they got stuck. Since the learning was very
                    self-paced, it was up to us to make sure that kids weren’t just blindly copying code and instead
                    truly understanding it. When they got stuck, I made sure to break down the concepts to them in a
                    simple way so they could understand what happened, and how they should fix it. It wasn’t always easy
                    - sometimes it would take a while to debug the code and figure out where the issue is. However, I
                    welcomed the challenge and had a lot of fun working with the kids and sharing my passion for
                    programming.

                <h2 class="jobTitle">RSM Homework Helper</h2>
                <h3 class="jobDuration">October 2023 - Present</h3>
                <img src="images/rsmLogo.png" class="jobImage">
                <p>I’ve always loved math, and when I was given the opportunity to be a Homework Helper/Math Tutor at
                    RSM, I took it. Kids come in with the questions they had from their homework, and it is our job to
                    help them through it. No matter which student I am helping, whether they need help with just one
                    question or understanding a new concept, I give all my effort in making sure that they understand
                    how to do each problem so when they are given another one like it, they can do it on their own. I
                    implement a variety of teaching styles to figure out which way works best with the student. Just
                    because one explanation worked for one student, doesn’t mean it will work for another. Watching the
                    understanding dawn on a student's face always brings me immense satisfaction, reaffirming my passion
                    for teaching and the impact I can make.
