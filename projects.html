                <h3 class="timePeriod">Summer 2024</h3>
                <p>Drought is a serious issue, as it can have severe impacts on agriculture and food security. Less
                    rainfall leads to crops not growing well, more pests and diseases for plants, and health problems
                    for livestock. These issues can lead to the prices of important foods rising, and harm the economy.
                    By more accurately predicting droughts, more preventative measures could be taken to reduce the
                    impact caused by less rainfall, therefore mitigating the economic impact and reducing the risk of
                    food insecurity. <br><br>

                    Using a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cdminix/us-drought-meteorological-data/data"
                        target="_blank">dataset from Kaggle</a> that sourced
                    information from the U.S. Drought Monitor, I created a machine learning model to predict the level
                    of drought (from None to D4, the most extreme type of drought) using meteorological data, such as
                    temperature, humidity, and wind speed. <br><br>

                    Please look through the code on my <a href="https://github.com/sanvi-g07/drought-prediction">GitHub
                        repository</a> for this project to learn more about how the model works.<br><br>

                    I determined that the most accurate model overall was the Random Forest without resampling, with an
                    accuracy of 81%. With further modifications and real-time data, this model has the potential to help
                    in earlier detection of droughts, and have a positive impact on agriculture and economy all over the
                    world.

                    <p>This program delved into big data, its significance, and how it is applied in the real world.
                        Big data can be characterized by three Vs: volume, velocity, and variety. There is a huge amount
                        of data today, which can be processed at incredibly fast speeds, including real time, and there
                        is a wide variety of data, such as photo, audio, or text. We learned about how big data has been
                        applied and transformed different industries, such as medicine, crime prevention, and smart
                        cities. Each day, we found how big data could be found in a news story, and discussed how and
                        why big data is having an impact. There was also a focus on the ethics surrounding big data,
                        including AI and data privacy. We used what we learned to create a final project, proposing how
                        big data could be used in any industry and how it could be beneficial. My group chose the
                        farming industry. Click the image on the right to see our slideshow.

                    <p>Through the Girls Who Code Self-Paced Summer Program, I was able to learn a lot about Data
                        Science + AI and Cybersecurity, and complete a variety of projects in order to learn different
                        concepts. Here are links to some of the projects I made, along with a brief summary of what it
                        is:

                            <div class="projectDescription">
                                This project takes images of different letters in sign language and classifies what
                                letter the image is displaying with a neural network. This tool would allow for the
                                creation of a sign language-to-English tool, allowing people who are deaf or hard of
                                hearing to communicate with those who donâ€™t know sign language more easily.

                                In this project, patient health information, such as BMI, smoking history, and alcohol
                                consumption, is used to classify whether a patient has heart disease or not using a
                                decision tree. A tool such as this would be very helpful in the healthcare industry, as
                                earlier detection of heart disease would lead to earlier treatment, therefore increasing
                                the likelihood of survival.

                                Through this project, I learned how to represent data using different Python

                                this project, I compared the female average/median years of schooling with
                                the proportion of women living in a household with electricity in Ethiopia and Colombia.
                                Finding a stark difference between the two, I did research to figure out what could be
                                contributing to that.
